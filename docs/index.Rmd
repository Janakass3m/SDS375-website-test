I am currently a Statistics and Data Science student at The University of Texas at Austin. In my free time I enjoy listening to music. My favorite artists at the moment are Daniel Caesar, Malcolm Todd, and Giveon. Other than music, I also like to travel and explore new countries. I have been to 5 out of the 7 continents.

<p>Favorite Shows:</p>
